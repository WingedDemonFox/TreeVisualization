# TreeVisualization

An educational application to support the training of various tree algorithms.

At the moment (March 2021), this project provides an empty template of a binary tree and various given unit tests for support. 
In addition, the blazor application in this solution provides a visualization of the implemented binary tree to assist in finding problems.
